 * in user and `GET /contacts` — and warmed opportunistically from search results.
 *
 * Anything still unresolved renders as a short id rather than a guess. A message attributed to the
 * wrong person is worse than one attributed to nobody, and in a chat whose whole point is
 * authenticated authorship it would undercut the guarantee outright.
